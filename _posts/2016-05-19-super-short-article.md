Welcome to my site. This website is where I will put basic information about myself. 
This site was made for a computer science course as an extra credit assignment.

Extra Credit Assignment: The Assignment is to use a jekyll template from github to make a github website.
This involves forking it and editing off it. I decided to use github desktop as GUI appears to be easier for 
me to use for now.
