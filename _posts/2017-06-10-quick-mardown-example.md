This website was made off a template. The template was Jeffreytse.
I picked it because it seemed both basic and looked of good quality. 
I picked another template that worked but upon further digging for an hour I could not get it working.
The template seems more blog oriented, with the posts being the main presentation of the site.
I don't mind it, but I am unsure if it is fit for the assignment, though it probably will be.
There are certain parts of this page I am not able or do not know how to change, but the posts seem to
be pretty easy to access.
