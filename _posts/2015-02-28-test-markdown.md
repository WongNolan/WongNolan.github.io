Hi! 
I am a relatively normal college sophomore currently attending Michigan State University.
My current major is Computer Science, as I've always been around them all my life, and 
love to learn how they work, so I can do cool stuff with them.

I have a lot of passions not related to my major, and I consider myself to be above average in terms
of dedication to them. Firstly, I have a strong intrest in history and warfare, as I find that stuff extremely
intresting and riveting. I'm only marginally more knowledgable about stuff like US history or recent events,
however I find the events of europe between 1917 and 1939 (The interwar period) to be extremely intresting,
especially the russian civil war and the associating wars sprung off of it.

Other passions involve chess, which I play quite a bit, and do seem to be above average in. I find myself
intruiged by the ammount of strategy and tactical thinking when playing chess. I think a good skill I
picked up from that is vertical thinking, which is a fancy way of saying to think ahead. Chess reinforces
this in the most basic steps possible allowing the game to essentially be a contest of who can think more
ahead, which I really like.

I also  have passions for both music and video games. I have some experience as a aclassical piano player,
and enjoy many differnt types of music. Video game are well and truly my hobby, and I believe there is some
real merit when it comes to creativity and general intellgence being developed when it comes to competetive
games.
